# Binoc: The Missing Changelog for Datasets

Binoc generates changelogs for datasets that don't have them. Given a series of snapshots of a dataset downloaded at different times, Binoc detects what changed, expresses those changes as a minimal structured diff, and produces human-readable summaries that distinguish substantive policy changes from ministerial housekeeping.

The core workflow: an archivist, data scientist, or steward has five copies of a government dataset containing CSVs, downloaded over two years. Some are identical. Some have reordered columns. One has a new category relevant to their research. Binoc tells them exactly what changed, when, and whether (by their definition) it matters.

## Example

A dataset ships as a zip of CSVs alongside a SQLite database. Between quarterly releases, the CSV columns were reordered and the database grew:

```bash
binoc diff release-q3/ release-q4/
```

```
# Changelog: release-q3/ → release-q4/

## Ministerial Changes

- **data.zip/agencies.csv**: Columns reordered (content unchanged)

## Substantive Changes

- **summary.sqlite**: Content changed (12.0 KB → 12.0 KB)
```

Binoc looked inside the zip and compared the CSV column-by-column — the reorder is flagged as ministerial housekeeping, not a real data change. But `.sqlite` is opaque to the standard library, so you only learn that the bytes differ.

```bash
pip install binoc-sqlite
binoc diff release-q3/ release-q4/
```

```
# Changelog: release-q3/ → release-q4/

## Ministerial Changes

- **data.zip/agencies.csv**: Columns reordered (content unchanged)

## Substantive Changes

- **summary.sqlite/allocations**: 3 rows added (84 → 87 rows)
```

Same command, richer output. The plugin parsed the database and found the actual change: three new rows in the `allocations` table. Plugins install via pip and work immediately — no configuration required.

## Why It Exists

Datasets published by governments, research institutions, and public bodies are living artifacts, and can change without warning or documentation (or without consistent documentation). The archival and data science communities need tooling to:

- Detect whether a new snapshot of a dataset actually differs from the previous one.
- Describe changes precisely — not just "the file changed," but "three columns were reordered (ministerial) and one column was split into two (substantive)."
- Produce changelogs that are machine-readable for automated pipelines and human-readable for policy analysis.
- Handle real-world messiness: datasets inside zip archives, nested containers, mixed formats, renamed files.

Generic diff tools don't understand data formats, while version control systems track lines, not columns or schemas. Binoc bridges this gap.

## Current Capabilities

- Compare directory snapshots recursively
- Diff zip archives, including nested zip contents
- Compare CSV files with row, column, and cell awareness
- Compare text files at line level
- Compare binary files by content hash
- Detect moves and copies from content hashes
- Extract actual changed data from migration nodes (added rows, text diffs, etc.)
- Render migrations as JSON or Markdown changelogs
- Extend comparison and transformation pipelines from Rust stdlib plugins or Python-authored plugins

## Quick Start

### Install via pip (recommended)

```bash
pip install binoc
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
uvx binoc diff path/to/snapshot-a path/to/snapshot-b
```

### Usage

Diff two snapshots (prints a Markdown changelog to stdout by default):

```bash
binoc diff path/to/snapshot-a path/to/snapshot-b
```

Get raw migration JSON instead:

```bash
binoc diff path/to/snapshot-a path/to/snapshot-b --format json
```

Save outputs to files (format inferred from extension, or use `format:path` syntax):

```bash
binoc diff path/to/snapshot-a path/to/snapshot-b \
  -o migration.json -o CHANGELOG.md -q
```

Combine saved migrations into a changelog:

```bash
binoc changelog migrations/*.json
```

Extract the actual changed data from a migration node (requires original snapshots):

```bash
binoc extract migration.json data.csv rows_added
```

### Plugins

Third-party plugin packs extend binoc with domain-specific comparators and transformers. Install a plugin and its formats are available automatically:

```bash
pip install binoc-sqlite                # SQLite schema + row count diffing
binoc diff snapshots/v1 snapshots/v2    # .sqlite/.db files now get semantic diffs
```

Or with `uvx`, no install needed:

```bash
uvx binoc --with binoc-sqlite diff snapshots/v1 snapshots/v2
```

See [docs/writing_plugins.md](docs/writing_plugins.md) for plugin authoring details and [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) for architecture.

### Rust-only CLI

A standalone Rust binary with standard library plugins (no Python, no plugin discovery) is also available:

```bash
cargo install binoc-cli
binoc-cli diff path/to/snapshot-a path/to/snapshot-b
```

### Development

Prerequisites: [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), [just](https://github.com/casey/just) (`brew install just`), and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
just build   # Rust workspace + Python bindings
just test    # full suite: Rust + Python
just docs    # regenerate tutorial after code changes
```

To test the full Python CLI with local plugin crates (no PyPI needed):

```bash
uv run --with ./binoc-python --with ./binoc-sqlite \
  binoc diff path/to/snapshot-a path/to/snapshot-b
```

This builds both packages from source and wires up entry-point discovery automatically. The same pattern works for any local plugin crate that has a `pyproject.toml` with a `[project.entry-points."binoc.plugins"]` section. For a self-contained plugin example (install, run, test vectors), see [binoc-sqlite/README.md](binoc-sqlite/README.md).

## Workspace Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `binoc-core/` | Controller, IR, config, traits, and output functions |
| `binoc-stdlib/` | Standard comparators and transformers |
| `binoc-cli/` | CLI library + standalone Rust binary |
| `binoc-python/` | PyO3 bindings, Python plugin discovery, and `binoc` CLI entry point |
| `binoc-sqlite/` | Demo plugin: SQLite schema and row count diffing |
| `test-vectors/` | Test files demonstrating (and confirming) binoc output for major capabilities |
| `docs/` | Documentation and design notes |


## Future Work

- Additional plugins such as Excel, Parquet, PDF, tar
- `binoc plugin install` / `binoc plugin list` CLI subcommands
- Richer Python notebook ergonomics
- Additional output formatters (HTML, LLM-summarized)
- Memory-bounded processing for very large trees
- Similarity-based rename detection for modified-and-moved files
- Fixed-point transformer iteration (tranformers currently run in a single pass, may miss optimizations)
